        <h1>How we counted this</h1>

        <p>It turns out time-since-government is surprisingly subjective and,
        in particular, our approach does <em>not</em> match Guinness World Record's
        methodology. That is time for <em>government formation</em>,
        based on days since the most recent election. Belgium holds the record at 541 days.</p>

        <p>However, NI was without a government for
        around two months prior to the last election, which had no impact on the stalemate,
        so we have calculated based
        on time since official government collapse. It is likely that the same Belgian crisis is
        also the longest time without an elected government in a developed country during peacetime,
        but there is no official Guinness World Record.
        To make this clearer, we have tweaked our wording.</p>

        <p>The two dates we have used are the dates of the
        prior elections being called:
        <ul>
            <li>NI: <strong>16th January 2017</strong>, called in Stormont a week
                after the resignation of the Deputy First Minister
                <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-northern-ireland-politics-38635708">(more)</a>,</p>
            <li>Belgium: <strong>26th April 2010</strong>, called by the King on the day
                of the resignation of the Prime Minister.</p>
        </ul>

        <p>Belgium did not have an official government again until 6th December 2011, 589 days later.</p>

        <p>Either way, Guinness World Records have confirmed that Northern Ireland is
        not eligible to receive the record. Nonetheless, NI will still pass Belgium's
        record very shortly, so our ticker will keep counting.</p>

        <p>Thanks to, amongst others,
        <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-northern-ireland-politics-45134828?__twitter_impression=true">Guinness World Records &amp; BBC News</a>
        for clarifying the official position.

        with any specific events or political perspectives.</p>

        <p>However, we realise that people visiting here may be looking for this detail,
        as the lack of government has direct, practical impact on individuals and communities in NI.
        A number of activities are running around Northern Ireland;
        some, such as those organised under
        <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeDeserveBetter">#WeDeserveBetter</a>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/August28">#August28</a>,
        actively protesting the current lack of
        government, and some simply marking the day, as in Belgium seven years ago.</p>
